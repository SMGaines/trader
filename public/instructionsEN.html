    <ul>
        <li>Players start with $100,000 and have to buy and sell shares on the stock market to maximise their profit.</li>
        <li>The winner is the person who has the highest <b>Net Worth</b> (Cash + Shares value) at the end of the game</li>
        <li>The game lasts for two 'years' and every month, an 'event' occurs such as a 'boom' or 'crash' or even a lottery win! (see full list below). </li>
        <li>Skillfully reacting to these events is the key to success!</li>
        <li>Insider Trading allows you to get secret information about the Stock Market ahead of time - but don't get caught or you'll go to prison!</li>
        <li>Watch out for other players 'hacking' your account to steal your cash!</li>
        <li>If you go bankrupt, you're out of the game!</li>
